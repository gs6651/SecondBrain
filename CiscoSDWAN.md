# Components

#### Validator (vBond)

- This device acts as an 'authenticator'. Think of it as a Gatekeeper (Bar Analogy).
- Orchestrates control & management plane
- WAN Edges are preconfigured with Validator IPs. It exchanges certificates with WAN Edges. After successful authentication, shares the IPs of Manager & Controller.
- Requires public IP reach-ability. Could sit behind 1:1 NAT.
- Highly resilient.
- Between Validator & WAN Edge there is a dynamic DTLS tunnel, which goes down after successful authentication.
- Facilitates NAT-Traversal. Validator acts as a STUN Server: **S**ession **T**raversal **U**tilities for **N**AT

#### Manager (vManage)

- Management-Plane
- Can be a Virtual Device (VM), On-Prem or Cloud Installation
- Itâ€™s a single pane of glass for Day0, Day1 & Day2 operations.
- It does:
  - Centralized Provisioning
  - Policies & Templates
  - Troubleshooting & Monitoring
  - Software Upgrades
- It does not establish OMP tunnels with WAN Edges.
- To push config to WAN Edges, it uses NETCONF APIs over DTLS Tunnels.
- Validator is also configured via Manager. ðŸ’ª

#### Analytics (vAnalytics)

- An optional component of SD-WAN fabric and only available as a SAAS (same like O365).
- Offers insights into the performance of applications and the underlying SD-WAN network infrastructure. e.g., link utilization, performance, delay etc.
- Manager collects data from all WAN Edges and shares the raw data with Analytics, then it presents it in a better way.

#### Controller (vSmart)

- Control Plane. Brain of the SD-WAN.
- Distributes control plane information to the WAN Edges using OMP. Also implements control plane policies such as service-chaining, multi-topology and multi-hop.
- Distributes data plane and app aware routing policies to the WAN Edges.
- All the policies are defined centrally on Manager and distributed to WAN Edges using Controller.
- Controller does not store policies locally, it only loads the currently active policy in its running-configuration.
- WAN Edges talks to Controller, but not with each other. It acts as a Route-Reflector and does not participate in Data-Plane, which means if youâ€™re on WAN Edge #1, and look for a route from WAN Edge #2, next hop would be WAN Edge #2 and not Controller.

#### WAN Edge (vEdge)

- Data-Plane
- Communicates to Controller controllers using OMP to setup the Data Flow
- Each WAN Edge is uniquely identified by its Chassis ID and serial number
- Establishes permanent tunnels with Manager & Controller, but dynamic tunnels with Validator.
- Tunnels to Controller are established via each available transport on WAN Edge.

## Misc.

#### VPN_0

- Transport VPN, can neither be deleted or modified
- The purpose is to enforce a separation between the WAN transport networks (the underlay) and network services (the overlay).
- Authentication traffic between Validator & WAN Edges
- Template deployment traffic between Manager & WAN Edges.

#### VPN_512: Out of Band Mgmt VPN (Mgmt VRF)

#### Service VPN

- Where LAN is connected
- Ranges between 1 -to- 65530 (except 512, reserved for OOBM). Depending on hardware or license can support a limited number of service VPNs.
- E.g., Data users in VPN 10, Voice Users in VPN 11. It's a kind of segments in the VeloCloud world.

#### Transport Side

- Controllers or WAN Edges side (interfaces) connected to the underlay/WAN network. Always VPN0.
- Traffic typically tunneled / encrypted. In some special cases we need to specifically tell WAN Edges not to encrypt traffic but rather send it as native like in case of Direct Internet Access or split-tunnel.

#### Service Side

- WAN Edge interfaces facing LAN
- Traffic is forwarded as is from the original source

#### DTLS vs TLS

- Cisco SD WAN supports two Transport Layer Security protocols to provide end-to-end transport security
- DTLS uses UDP and implements its own sequence numbers, fragment offers and re-transmissions because UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery of packets. DTLS is default, because itâ€™s faster compared to TLS.
- TLS uses TCP.
- Both are used between Manager, Controller & Validator and they use protocol NETCONF for communication with each other.

#### Gateway Tracking

This feature that is enabled by default and canâ€™t be stopped or modified. Each device probes using ARP the next-hop IP of each underlay static route every 10 seconds. If the device receives an ARP response, it maintains the static route in the VPN0â€™s routing table. If the device misses ten consecutive ARP responses for a next-hop IP, the device removes the static route that points to this IP from the routing table.

#### NETCONF

Network management protocol to manage remote configurations. It works on the RPC layer (Remote Procedure Call) and uses XML or JSON for data encoding. Typically the protocol messages are exchanged over the TLS with mutual X.509 authentication.

# OMP
- TCP based protocol
- OMP peering is between devicesâ€™ system-IPs, itâ€™s not bound to any of DTLS control connections to Controller
- There will be only one peering between WAN Edge & Controller, irrespective of number of WAN connections available

### OMP is responsible for distribution of:
- TLOCs among network sites
- Service side reach-ability information
- Service-Chaining information
- Data-Plane security parameters, VPN labels & crypto keys
- Data & Application Aware Routing (AAR) policies

### Routes advertisement with OMP: (3 Types)

- **OMP routes:** Prefixes at the local site that are redistributed into OMP and advertised towards the controllers. Basically the LAN routes. It can be OSPF, BGP, static or connected routes, or any other routing information present on the site. OMP routes resolve their next-hop to a TLOC. An OMP route is installed in the forwarding table only if the next-hop TLOC is known and there is a BFD session in UP state associated with that TLOC. By default, OMP only advertises the best route out of multiple equal ones. If no policy is applied, advertise all TLOCs to all WAN Edges. It carries below attributes:
  - VPN Number: 1 -to- 65530 (except 512, reserved for OOBM).
  - *Originator*: System-IP of WAN Edge
  - *TLOC*: Next-Hop identifier of the OMP routes
  - *Site-IDs*: Similar to BGP ASN. All sites must have a unique Site-ID, and all WAN Edges must have the same Site-ID on the same site.
  - *Origin-Protocol:* From where WAN Edge has learned it i.e., via connected, static or any dynamic routing protocol
  - *Origin-Metric*: It helps in the best-path algorithm when OMP calculates the most optimal routes toward destinations
  - *OMP Preference:* Similar to BGPâ€™s local-preference. Higher is better. To influence the best path selection in OMP
  - *Tag*: Similar to route-tag. Itâ€™s a transitive attribute

- **TLOC routes:** These are the tunnel endpoints on the WAN Edge routers that connect to the transport networks. Basically the WAN routes. These routes are advertised along with additional attributes such as public and private IP addresses, color, TLOC preference, site ID, weight, tags, and encryption keys. System-IP address is used instead of the interface IP address as an identifier for a TLOC route. A TLOC route advertisement contains the following attributes:
  - Private IPv4/IPv6 addresses and ports: DHCP or manually configured IPs on WAN interfaces
  - Public IPv4/IPv6 addresses and ports: If the WAN Edge sits behind a NAT device, the outside NATed IP addresses and ports are included in the TLOC route advertisements. If not behind NAT, the public and private addresses and ports are the same
  - Color: For logical abstraction between multiple WAN types
  - Encapsulation Type: GRE or IPsec. Must match with remote TLOC
  - TLOC Preference: To influence OMP Best path when having multi-paths. Higher is better, default is 0.
  - Site-ID: To identify the originating site. If remote & local WAN Edges Site-ID is the same, they  will not form a tunnel.
  - Tag: User defined value that can be acted upon in a control policy
  - Weight: A parameter to achieve unequal traffic distribution across multiple TLOCs with equal preferences. Higher means more flows will go through that TLOC compared to other TLOC on WAN Edge.

* **Service routes:**  These are used to exchange embedded services such as firewall, IPS, application-specific optimizations, and load-balancers. Network Service (FW, IPS etc.) must be Layer-2 adjacent to WAN Edge (There must not be a Layer 3 device in-between).  Controller does not advertise Service routes to WAN Edges. Service routes contains the following attributes:
  * VPN-ID: VPN that the service applies to
  * Service-ID: Type of service that is being advertised. 7 pre-defined
    * FW maps to svc-id 1;
    * IDS maps to svc-id 2;
    * IDP maps to svc-id 3;
    * Custom Services: For customer defined
      * netsvc1 maps to svc-id 4;
      * netsvc2 maps to svc-id 5;
      * netsvc3 maps to svc-id 6;
      * netsvc4 maps to svc-id 7;
  * Originator ID: System-IP of the WAN Edge that originates the service route
  * TLOC: Where service is located.

### OMP Best-Path Selection

- By default, only the best 4 routes (according to OMP Best-Path Algorithm) are advertised out. Maximum 16 can be advertised. To change the behavior on Controller, use the command: `omp send-path-limit <1-16>`. Controllers can also be configured to send a backup path (`omp send-backup-paths`).
- The OMP best-path algorithm sorts the best routes in descending order (from best to worst).
- The Controller always inserts and keeps all routes sorted, with the best route at the top.
- The `omp send-path-limit <1-16>` parameter defines the maximum number of best-paths that can be advertised.
- The `omp ecmp-limit <5>` parameter defines the maximum number of best paths that can be installed in the routing table.
- The `controller-send-path-limit` defines the maximum number of best-paths that a Controller can advertise to another Controller.
- The `omp send-backup-paths` tell Controller to advertise the first set of non-best routes.
- Route State: A route is ACTIVE when there is an OMP session in UP state with the peer that sent out the route. A route is STALE when the OMP session with the peer that sent out the route is in GRACEFUL RESTART mode
- Route Resolve-ability: Valid & Reachable next-hop TLOC
- Admin Distance: WAN Edge Only. Locally significant. OMP has AD of 250 on WAN Edges (Viptela) and 251 on WAN Edges (Cisco). AD is not a parameter in OMP, is not advertised, and does not influence Controller.
- Route Preference: Default OMP route preference is 0. 
- TLOC Preference: WAN Edge Only. TLOC routes are not bound to VPN-id. Therefore, changing the TLOC preference affects WAN Edges path selection for all VPNs.
- Origin:
  - Connected 
  - Static
  - EIGRP summary
  - eBGP 
  - OSPF intra-area 
  - OSPF inter-area
  - IS-IS level 1
  - EIGRP external
  - OSPF external 
  - IS-IS level 2
  - iBGP 
  - Unknown
- Origin Metric: If Origin type is same, select the route with lower origin metric
- Tiebreaker 1 (Source Preference): Controller only. Prefer WAN Edge sourced routes over Controller sourced
- Tiebreaker 2 (System IP): Select the routes that have the lowest router-id (System-IP).
- Tiebreaker 3 (Private TLOC IP): For routes coming from the same WAN Edge, prefer the ones with a lower private TLOC IP address.

#### OMP Graceful Restart:

- When SD WAN control Plane becomes unavailable, data planes continue functioning and forwarding traffic. Cisco WAN Edge and Controller devices cache the OMP information that they learn from peers. The cached information includes OMP, TLOC, and SERVICE routes, IPsec SA parameters, and the centralized data policies in place.
**TLOC Action** is a control-policy option that inserts an intermediate hop in an OMP route to a destination prefix. The intermediate TLOC and the ultimate TLOC must be the same color for the tloc-action to work. The intermediate router must be enabled for service TE. There are four TLOC-action (s):
- Primary
- Backup
- ECMP
- Strict (default)

# TLOC

- Transport Locator
- Collection of entities making up a transport side connection. Think of it as a identity card given to WAN interfaces, it uniquely identifies with tuple of three values:
  - System-IP: Itâ€™s similar to router-ID and does not need to be route-able or reachable across the fabric
  - Transport Color: Interface identifier on local WAN Edge. One color for MPLS and other one for Internet etc.
  - Encapsulation: The type of encapsulation this TLOC uses - IPsec or GRE.
- Transport interfaces (ones with TLOC configuration) do not forward traffic. They only serve as tunnel endpoints for the overlay tunnels
- TLOC Restrict: To restrict tunnels within same color
- TLOC Carrier: Between two clouds
- Tunnel Group:
  - Only one interface can be marked with a particular color per WAN edge router. That's a limitation of color, and Tunnel Group comes into picture.
  - TLOCs can only establish tunnels with remote TLOCs with the same tunnel-group IDs irrespective of the TLOC color.
  - TLOCs with any tunnel-group ID will also form tunnels with TLOCs that have no tunnel-group IDs assigned.
  - If the restrict-option is configured in conjunction with the tunnel-group option, then TLOCs will only form an overlay tunnel to remote TLOCs having the same tunnel-group ID and TLOC color.
- NAT Detection
- All Cisco SD-WAN devices have an embedded STUN client and the Validator orchestrator acts as a STUN Server (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT).

#### NAT Types:

- **Full-Cone NAT:** A full-cone is one where all packets from the same internal IP address are mapped to the same NAT IP address. External hosts can send packets to the internal host, by sending packets to the mapped NAT IP address. In other words, One-to-One NAT.
- **Restricted-Cone NAT:** Same as Full-Cone NAT, only difference is that an external host can send packets to the internal host only if the internal host had previously sent a packet to that IP address. Once the NAT mapping state is created, the external destination can communicate back to the internal host on any port. It is also known as Address-Restricted-Cone.
- **Port-Restricted-Cone NAT:** Same as Restricted-Cone NAT, but the restriction also includes port numbers. The difference is that an external destination can send back packets to the internal host only if the internal host had previously sent a packet to this destination on this exact port number. It is known as Port Address Translation (PAT).
- **Symmetric:** In this NAT, all requests from the same internal IP & port to a specific destination IP & port, are mapped to a unique NAT IP & and NAT port. Only the external destination that received a packet can send packets back to the internal host. It is the most restrictive of all other types. It is also known as Port Address Translation (PAT) with port-randomization.
- Recommendation is to have Full-Cone NAT at the Hubs, DC, DR sites.
- In GRE tunnels, any type of NAT with port overloading is not supported since GRE packets lack an L4 header.

* Loopback TLOC: When loopback interface is used as local TLOC endpoint.
  - Standard Mode: Loopback interface bound to multiple physical interfaces. The service provider network must have IP reach-ability to the loopback IP. Tunnel config would be done under loopback instead of physical interface.
  - Bind Mode: Loopback interface is strictly bound to a single physical link. Used when the last mile provider assigns an IP address to the WAN link, and this IP is filtered within the MPLS cloud or in another transit WAN along the way. Command is:  `bind <interface>`.

# Policies

#### Structure of Policy

- **Step #1: List**: Site lists (which site (Branch 1, Branch 2, HUB etc.), VPN lists, TLOC lists, access-lists, prefix-lists, as-path-lists. Basically we create group of interests.
- **Step #2: Definition:** What Action. Here we *match* everything defined in step #1 as per our need and accordingly *action* will be taken on it.
- **Step #3: Application:** Where to apply policy. (in-bound or out-bound)

> Manager will push centralized policy to Controller via NETCONF transaction. Then further, policy itself won't be pushed to the WAN edge devices, only the results of the policy (after processing by Controller) are advertised via OMP to the overlay.Â Â Â Â 

#### Centralized policies

<img title="" src="https://cdn.networkacademy.io/sites/default/files/2022-04/types-of-sdwan-policies.svg" alt="Types of Cisco SD-WAN Policies" width="634">

- One type of policy can be applied to a site-list. For example, one control-policy in and one control-policy out but not two control policies in the outbound direction.
- Cisco does not recommend including a site in more than one site-list. Doing this may result in unpredictable behavior of the policies applied to these site-lists.
- The direction of the policy is always **from the perspective of the Controller controller**.
  - Outbound means Controller to WAN Edges and does ***not*** affect the best path selection process and influences only the specific edges in the contorl policy's site list.
  - Inbound means WAN Edges to Controller and it will modifies the attributes in OMP updates before routing information enters the RIB of Controller. It affects the complete overlay fabric.
- **Centralized-*Control*-policy** is use to influence 'route' & 'TLOC' between Controller & WAN edges. It is unidirectional which means it will be applied either inbound or outbound. For example, If we need to manipulate OMP routes that the controller sends and receives, we must configure two control policies. It's of two types:
	- *Topology Policies:* To limit the number of overlay tunnels between sites and controlling the overlay topology.
	- *VPN Membership Policies:* To control the distribution of routing information for specific VPNs. A typical use-case is for creating guest networks that have Internet access but site-to-site communication is restricted.
- **Centralized-*Data*-policy** is directional and can be applied either to the traffic received from the service side of the WAN Edge router, traffic received from the transport side, or both.
- VPN membership policy is always applied to traffic outbound from the Controller controller.

### Order-of-Operation on WAN Edge

- *IP lookup*: 1st thing 1st, IP address lookup, because WAN Edges at the heart are routers ðŸ™‚.
- *Local Ingress Policy*: Localized policies are typically used to create ACLs and tie them to WAN Edge interfaces. ACLs can be used for filtering, marking, and traffic policing.
- *Centralized App-Route Policy*: or App-Aware Routing. If itâ€™s configured, the packet being inspected makes a routing decision based on the defined SLA characteristics such as packet loss, latency, jitter, load, cost, and bandwidth of a link.
- *Centralized Data Policy*: It is evaluated after the App-Aware Routing policy and is able to override the App-Aware Routing forwarding decision.
- *Forwarding*: At this point, the destination IP address is compared against the routing table, and the output interface is determined.
- *Security Policy*: If there are security services attached to the WAN Edge, they are processed in the following sequence - Firewall, IPS, URL-Filtering, and lastly AMP (Advanced Malware Protection). The necessary tunnel encapsulations are performed and VPN labels are inserted.
- *Local Egress Policy*: If traffic is denied or manipulated by the egress ACL, those changes will take effect before the packet is forwarded.
- *Queuing and Scheduling*: Egress traffic queuing services such as Low-Latency (LLQ) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR) queuing are performed before the packet leaves.
