# Postman for REST API Consumption

Postman is an API development environment that allows you to test, debug, monitor, document, and publish your APIs. You can easily create a REST API request and examine the API response through the simple GUI, without having to use a more complex method like a programming language library or command-line utility. Postman provides a set of tools that make it easy to get started with developing your first API and improving your knowledge of REST and HTTP with a learning-by-doing approach.

Here are some of the main features of Postman:

- **Test and debug your API:** You can create arbitrary HTTP requests, which help you verify the way your API behaves with different request parameters. You can test API authentication methods, simulate client inputs, and verify that your API provides appropriate response parameters, like HTTP status codes, response body, and cookies.
- **Organize and reuse API calls:** The Postman interface provides several organizational elements. A Workspace is a view of all Postman elements such as Collections, Monitors, and Environments. It also provides an easy way for teams to collaborate on developing and testing APIs. Team Workspaces can be shared between groups of users (teams), while Personal Workspaces are only visible to the owner. You can also share specific elements between different Workspaces and set specific permissions. Team members also have access to the full request history of all the Collections in a Workspace. All changes or updates to any Workspace element are synced in real time. A set of key-value pairs can be saved as an Environment. Environments let you customize requests using variables so that you can easily switch between different setups without changing your requests. Saved requests can be organized into Collections and Folders.
- **Run automated tests or tasks:** With the Collection Runner tool, you can create workflows that simulate your API use cases. You can send all requests in a Collection or Folder in an arbitrary sequence and even pass data between requests. That means, for example, you can create a workflow, where the first request authenticates to the API, receives an authentication token, and then the workflow uses that token to execute additional requests. With the Monitor tool, you can execute these workflows periodically so that you have a view of the performance and responsiveness of your API. Monitor also generates reports, which can be sent by email.
- **Document and publish:** Postman provides a very easy way to automatically document your APIs. You can generate the documentation for a selected Collection. The documentation includes the Collection, Folders and requests descriptions, saved requests with all the parameters (headers, body and so on), and code examples. Your documentation is formatted as a web page, published on the Postman servers, and can be accessed publicly. The documentation is created with the variable values from the currently selected environment. All changes to the Collection are synced to the documentation in real time so that you do not have to manually republish.
- **Create sample code:** Another very useful Postman tool is the Code Generator, which creates code samples for your request in several popular programming languages. You can simply reuse the code in your client application or use it with a utility, such as cURL or Wget.

When you are signed in with your Postman account, your data is synced across different devices. You can also access and manage your account and entities, like Workspaces, Collections, and Environments, from the Postman web site.

Postman is available as a standalone application for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be downloaded from [website](http://www.getpostman.com.). The website also features extensive documentation and video tutorials.

## GUI Overview

Postman provides an adaptable multitabbed user interface. From the header toolbar, you can create new entities, switch Workspaces, view the sync status, and manage your Postman account. The request builder and the response pane can be displayed horizontally or vertically in a two-pane view selection. The sidebar can display the history of sent requests or the list of Collections. Recently run requests are displayed in tabs. Unsaved requests are marked with a green dot. You can duplicate requests or drag and drop them between Folders and Collections. Postman can be run in multiple windows; for example, you can work in two Workspaces in separate windows at the same time.

In the following figure, the numbers mark these user interface parts:

## Composing an HTTP Request

An HTTP request consists of a method, a URI and optional HTTP headers, and request body. In Postman, you can construct arbitrary REST API requests.

Different types of authentication, such as basic HTTP authentication, OAuth 2.0, and API keys, are supported. You can also import certificates, which can be used to establish a Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) connection to the API server.

You can specify HTTP request headers, where the commonly used standard headers can be entered with the autocomplete function. Adding custom headers and values is also possible.

If your request contains some body content, you can enter it in the raw text format or use the input forms that Postman provides. The form-data and x-www-form-urlencoded options simulate filling and submitting a web form. You enter the key-value pairs in the same way you would fill a form on a website. The difference between these two options is that form-data adds the multipart/form-data Content-Type header, which allows for file uploads. If you choose the raw option, you use the Content-Type drop-down list to specify the type of content you entered in the request body pane, like JSON or XML. The syntax highlighting adapts, and the appropriate HTTP Content-Type header is attached automatically.

You can also add cookies to your request. You specify the cookie values and domain for which you would like to use that cookie. You can use multiple cookies for each domain.

## Composing an HTTP Request (Cont.)

In the response pane, you can verify the response that the client received from your API. You can view the HTTP status code, the response headers and body, and any cookies that were received. If you select the Pretty option in the response body, the response is formatted and highlighted according to the received Content-Type header. If the response is HTML formatted, you can also view it as a web page by choosing the Preview option.

You can also verify the size of the response and the response completion time, which can help you troubleshoot your API performance or connectivity issues. You can save a response as a text file or as an Example for your saved request. Examples contain a specific request with the corresponding response. You can save multiple Examples for each request. Saved Examples can also be viewed in the published documentation of your Collection.

You can use several methods to create new requests in Postman: from the launch screen at Postman startup, from the header toolbar, or by selecting the Add Request option from your existing Collection.

## Advanced Postman Topics

Postman allows you to organize your API calls into organizational elements, which can be reused and shared. Using variables for request parameters enables you to run the API calls on different environments without changing the code of the request.

### Collections

Saved requests can be organized into Collections. Requests, grouped in a Collection, would typically be part of the same project and share some common values, like the URI or authentication method and credentials. You can create variables with a Collection-wide scope and choose if a specific request inherits this variable value from the Collection. Grouping into Collections also makes the Workspace much cleaner and easier to manage. You can further organize saved requests into Folders inside Collections. You can also generate documentation for your Collection. Collections can be exported as JSON files.

### Variables

Variables are used to store dynamic information. Variables in Postman enable you to easily reuse API requests. For example, instead of hardcoding your API server IP address or FQDN, you can use a variable to reference it. If you move the API to a different server, instead of having to change all your requests, you just change the variable value once, in the scope where the variable is defined.

You can use variables in different elements in Postman, such as the URI, authorization parameters, headers, URL-encoded body keys and values, and so on. In Postman, variables are defined by a variable name inside curly brackets: `{{variable_name}}`. When you run an action in Postman, all occurrences of the variable name will be replaced with the matching variable value. Variables can have different scopes inside Postman, depending on where they are defined, from broader to narrower scope:

- Global
- Collection
- Environment
- Data
- Local

If variables with the same name are defined in two different scopes, the value of the narrower scope takes precedence. For example, if you have a variable `{{variable_name}}` defined with different values inside the Collection and inside the Environment, then all occurrences of `{{variable_name}}` in your request will get replaced by the value defined in the Environment.

When you create a variable in Postman, you specify the variable name, the initial value, and the current value. When Postman resolves a variable, for example, when a request is sent, the current value is used. When you share a Collection, the variables are replaced with the corresponding initial value, which means that you can safely share requests that contain private information like API keys or login credentials.

Postman also features autocomplete for inputting variables. The function is invoked when you enter a curly bracket and provides a list of available variables, their values, and scope.

Refer to the following figure. The example shows the list of variables defined in a Collection (1). These variables are then used in building a request (2) in the URI, the form body, and the authorization header. The example also shows the HTTP headers and body that were sent to the API (3). You can see that the variables were substituted with their current values. Note that the `{{server}}` variable (the Host part of the HTTP request) was not replaced with the current value from the Collection scope but was overridden by the value defined for the `{{server}}` variable in the Environment.

### Environments

In Postman, variables enable you to reuse values in different places in the Workspace. A set of variables and their values represent an Environment. A common use case would be to use the same Collections and Monitors for development, staging, and production APIs. You can simply change the Postman Environment from the drop-down list, and all the variables in your requests referring to server FQDNs, listening ports, credentials and so on will get set with appropriate values. That means that your saved requests would connect to APIs on different servers with different credentials without having to manually change any of the request parameters. Environments can be shared and exported as JSON files.

### Code Generator

After you have tested and verified that your API behaves as intended, you can incorporate the created API calls in your client application. Postman provides a very useful code generator tool that creates code snippets, which you can reuse in your application. The executed code will send the same HTTP request that you created in Postman, including URI, headers, cookies, and body. Some of the supported languages and frameworks are Node.js request, Python requests, jQuery AJAX, and cURL. You can also generate the content of a raw HTTP request.

The code generator can be run from the request builder. All the code examples also can be viewed in the published documentation.
