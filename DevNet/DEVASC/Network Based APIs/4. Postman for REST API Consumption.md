# Postman for REST API Consumption

Postman is an API development environment that allows you to test, debug, monitor, document, and publish your APIs. You can easily create a REST API request and examine the API response through the simple GUI, without having to use a more complex method like a programming language library or command-line utility. Postman provides a set of tools that make it easy to get started with developing your first API and improving your knowledge of REST and HTTP with a learning-by-doing approach.

Here are some of the main features of Postman:

- **Test and debug your API:** You can create arbitrary HTTP requests, which help you verify the way your API behaves with different request parameters. You can test API authentication methods, simulate client inputs, and verify that your API provides appropriate response parameters, like HTTP status codes, response body, and cookies.
- **Organize and reuse API calls:** The Postman interface provides several organizational elements. A Workspace is a view of all Postman elements such as Collections, Monitors, and Environments. It also provides an easy way for teams to collaborate on developing and testing APIs. Team Workspaces can be shared between groups of users (teams), while Personal Workspaces are only visible to the owner. You can also share specific elements between different Workspaces and set specific permissions. Team members also have access to the full request history of all the Collections in a Workspace. All changes or updates to any Workspace element are synced in real time. A set of key-value pairs can be saved as an Environment. Environments let you customize requests using variables so that you can easily switch between different setups without changing your requests. Saved requests can be organized into Collections and Folders.
- **Run automated tests or tasks:** With the Collection Runner tool, you can create workflows that simulate your API use cases. You can send all requests in a Collection or Folder in an arbitrary sequence and even pass data between requests. That means, for example, you can create a workflow, where the first request authenticates to the API, receives an authentication token, and then the workflow uses that token to execute additional requests. With the Monitor tool, you can execute these workflows periodically so that you have a view of the performance and responsiveness of your API. Monitor also generates reports, which can be sent by email.
- **Document and publish:** Postman provides a very easy way to automatically document your APIs. You can generate the documentation for a selected Collection. The documentation includes the Collection, Folders and requests descriptions, saved requests with all the parameters (headers, body and so on), and code examples. Your documentation is formatted as a web page, published on the Postman servers, and can be accessed publicly. The documentation is created with the variable values from the currently selected environment. All changes to the Collection are synced to the documentation in real time so that you do not have to manually republish.
- **Create sample code:** Another very useful Postman tool is the Code Generator, which creates code samples for your request in several popular programming languages. You can simply reuse the code in your client application or use it with a utility, such as cURL or Wget.

When you are signed in with your Postman account, your data is synced across different devices. You can also access and manage your account and entities, like Workspaces, Collections, and Environments, from the Postman web site.

Postman is available as a standalone application for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be downloaded from [website](http://www.getpostman.com.). The website also features extensive documentation and video tutorials.

## GUI Overview

Postman provides an adaptable multitabbed user interface. From the header toolbar, you can create new entities, switch Workspaces, view the sync status, and manage your Postman account. The request builder and the response pane can be displayed horizontally or vertically in a two-pane view selection. The sidebar can display the history of sent requests or the list of Collections. Recently run requests are displayed in tabs. Unsaved requests are marked with a green dot. You can duplicate requests or drag and drop them between Folders and Collections. Postman can be run in multiple windows; for example, you can work in two Workspaces in separate windows at the same time.

In the following figure, the numbers mark these user interface parts:

## Composing an HTTP Request

An HTTP request consists of a method, a URI and optional HTTP headers, and request body. In Postman, you can construct arbitrary REST API requests.

Different types of authentication, such as basic HTTP authentication, OAuth 2.0, and API keys, are supported. You can also import certificates, which can be used to establish a Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) connection to the API server.

You can specify HTTP request headers, where the commonly used standard headers can be entered with the autocomplete function. Adding custom headers and values is also possible.

If your request contains some body content, you can enter it in the raw text format or use the input forms that Postman provides. The form-data and x-www-form-urlencoded options simulate filling and submitting a web form. You enter the key-value pairs in the same way you would fill a form on a website. The difference between these two options is that form-data adds the multipart/form-data Content-Type header, which allows for file uploads. If you choose the raw option, you use the Content-Type drop-down list to specify the type of content you entered in the request body pane, like JSON or XML. The syntax highlighting adapts, and the appropriate HTTP Content-Type header is attached automatically.

You can also add cookies to your request. You specify the cookie values and domain for which you would like to use that cookie. You can use multiple cookies for each domain.

## Composing an HTTP Request (Cont.)

In the response pane, you can verify the response that the client received from your API. You can view the HTTP status code, the response headers and body, and any cookies that were received. If you select the Pretty option in the response body, the response is formatted and highlighted according to the received Content-Type header. If the response is HTML formatted, you can also view it as a web page by choosing the Preview option.

You can also verify the size of the response and the response completion time, which can help you troubleshoot your API performance or connectivity issues. You can save a response as a text file or as an Example for your saved request. Examples contain a specific request with the corresponding response. You can save multiple Examples for each request. Saved Examples can also be viewed in the published documentation of your Collection.

You can use several methods to create new requests in Postman: from the launch screen at Postman startup, from the header toolbar, or by selecting the Add Request option from your existing Collection.
