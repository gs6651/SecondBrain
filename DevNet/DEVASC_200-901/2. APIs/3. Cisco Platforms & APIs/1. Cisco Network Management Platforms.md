# Cisco Network Management Platforms

Several management products exist that can help manage service provider or enterprise networking solutions, or both. Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) can be used in enterprise environment to address all requirements of operating an enterprise network (WAN and LAN). Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) enables you to build an agile and dynamic data center environment where Cisco ACI can be integrated with northbound systems to dynamically provision data center networking resources to individual applications. Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) can be used to orchestrate and automate any diverse and multivendor environment, thus providing a single point to orchestrate services end to end and making the underlying network transparent.

The following figure illustrates a service provider network, although a similar illustration could be used to illustrate an enterprise network (by omitting some service provider-specific access and aggregation devices). Several requirements are used when designing networking and data center solutions. However, in modern environments, you aim to simplify the operations of the services and enable a dynamic and flexible approach where, ideally, the management tasks can be pushed all the way to the end users (application consumers). Having APIs enables the combining of different management platforms into orchestrated environments where application (service) instances can be provisioned, modified, or deleted in a single transaction.

## Cisco DNA

Intent-based networking (IBN) built on Cisco DNA takes a software-delivered approach to automating and assuring services across your WAN and your campus and branch networks. Cisco DNA enables you to streamline operations and facilitate IT and business innovation.

Cisco DNA is an open, extensible, software-driven architecture. Cisco DNA uses five fundamental new design principles for the networking software stack:

- **Virtualize everything** to give organizations freedom of choice to run any service anywhere, independent of the underlying platform—physical or virtual, on premises, or in the cloud.
- **Designed for automation** to make networks and services on those networks easy to deploy, manage, and maintain—fundamentally changing the approach to network management.
- **Pervasive analytics** to provide insights on the operation of the network, IT infrastructure, and the business—information that only the network can provide.
- **Service management delivered from the cloud** to unify policy and orchestration across the network—enabling the agility of cloud with the security and control of on-premises solutions.
- **Open, extensible, and programmable at every layer**, integrating Cisco and third-party technology, open APIs, and a developer platform, to support a rich ecosystem of network-enabled applications.

By enabling this architecture with services that can be delivered from the cloud, you use the cloud for what it does best—namely, lowering cost, ease of use, scale, and speed.

Cisco DNA is built on a set of design principles with the objective of providing:

- Insights and actions to drive faster business innovation
- Automation and assurance to lower costs and complexity while meeting business and user expectations
- Security and compliance to reduce risk as an organization continues to expand and grow

Cisco DNA is delivered across three layers:

- **Layer 1 is the network element layer:** Here, you have physical and virtual devices that bring together the network. A core principle at the network layer is virtualization. You can use Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization (E-NFV), which builds the full software stack from the infrastructure software that can reside on servers, to virtualized network functions like routing, firewalls, and the orchestration tools to support E-NFV on physical and virtual devices. The evolved Cisco IOS XE Software is much more open and programmable with model-driven APIs. In addition, you can more easily tap into the intelligence provided by the operating system and ASIC to support customized applications.

- **Layer 2 is the platform layer:** Here, use controllers to fully abstract the network and automate all-day 0, 1, and 2 functions. Through centralized policy control, you can allow IT to provide the business intent and have the controller drive enforcement dynamically through the network. Also at this level is where you can gather rich data analytics. A single analytics platform is used to provide structured data and open APIs that both Cisco and third parties can use to contextualize insights—relevant for businesses to better understand user behavior or Internet of Things (IoT) data, as well as IT to troubleshoot issues or identify threats faster.

- **Layer 3 is the network-enabled applications layer:** Layer 3 supports important business services like collaboration, mobility, and IoT. Both Cisco and third parties can write once and gain the intelligence of the network to better understand patterns (by correlating user, app, device data) for use cases that range from capacity planning to testing customer promotions.

As you build to the design principles, you will use the cloud for the following:

- **Cloud managed:** Using the cloud to securely manage all elements in the network through a single-pane view
- **Cloud edge:** Providing critical network functions at the edge to support businesses moving their operations to the cloud (like Amazon Web Services and Azure)
- **Cloud delivered:** Enabling flexible subscription models where possible, minimizing the infrastructure burden

Cisco DNA supports the critical northbound and southbound APIs to enable the broadest ecosystem to be supported.

The following figure illustrates the core components comprising the Cisco DNA solution.

The automation software provides policy-based orchestration, which can in turn be integrated with other northbound systems.

Cisco DNA Center is the network management system, foundational controller, and analytics platform at the heart of the Cisco intent-based network. Beyond device management and configuration, Cisco DNA Center is a set of software solutions that provide:

- A management platform for all your network
- A software-defined networking (SDN) controller for automation of your virtual devices and services
- An assurance engine to guarantee the best network experience for all your users

Cisco DNA Center software resides on the Cisco DNA Center Appliance and controls all your Cisco devices—both fabric and nonfabric.

**Design:** Design your network using physical maps and logical topologies for a quick visual reference.

**Policy:** Define user and device profiles that facilitate highly secure access and network segmentation, based on business needs.

**Provision:** Use policy-based automation to deliver services to the network based on business priority and to simplify device deployment.

**Assurance:** Combine deep insights with rich context to deliver a consistent experience and proactively optimize your network.

Cisco DNA Center allows IT teams the ability to automatically provision through Cisco DNA Center Automation, virtualize devices through Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization (E-NFV), and lower security risks through segmentation and Encrypted Traffic Analysis (ETA). Furthermore, Cisco DNA Center Assurance collects streaming telemetry from devices around the network to ensure alignment of network operation with the business intent. In doing this, Cisco DNA Center Assurance optimizes network performance, enforces network policies, and reduces time that is spent on mundane troubleshooting tasks. Cisco DNA Center Platform provides 360 degree extensibility with a broad ecosystem of partners that allow you to make your network agile and fully in-tune with your business priorities. Cisco DNA Center is the only centralized network management system to bring all this functionality into a single pane of glass.

## Cisco ACI

Cisco ACI is a data center SDN solution that is used to allow applications to dynamically request data center network resources. Cisco ACI consists of the data center networking infrastructure that is controlled by a Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC).

![alt text](/DevNet/DEVASC_200-901/Images/image-2315.png)

Cisco APIC is the main architectural component of the Cisco ACI solution. It is the unified point of automation and management for the Cisco ACI fabric, policy enforcement, and health monitoring. The controller optimizes performance and manages and operates a scalable multitenant Cisco ACI fabric.

Cisco ACI is a centralized application-level policy engine for physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructures, and it provides the following capabilities:

- Detailed visibility, telemetry, and health scores by application and by tenant
- Designed around open standards and open APIs
- Robust implementation of multitenant security, quality of service (QoS), and high availability
- Integration with management systems such as VMware, Microsoft, and OpenStack
- Cloud APIC appliance for Cisco Cloud ACI deployments of public cloud environments

Cisco APIC is a single point of automation and management for the Cisco ACI fabric:

- Centralized controller for ACI fabric
- Web HTML5 GUI and RESTful API (XML or JavaScript Object Notation [JSON])
- Application-oriented network policy
- Extensive third-party integration (65+ partners)
- ACI App Center extends functionality

![alt text](/DevNet/DEVASC_200-901/Images/image-2316.png)

Designed for automation, programmability, and centralized management, the Cisco APIC itself exposes northbound APIs through XML and JSON. It provides both a CLI and GUI, which utilize the APIs to manage the fabric holistically.

## Cisco NSO

Whether architecting a service orchestration tool chain or building a DevOps environment, the underlying automation strategies have typically expected developers to understand how infrastructure works and infrastructure owners to be conversant with application development and service creation. Real-world experiences show that this approach is flawed. Cisco NSO enabled by Tail-f offers a more realistic approach by serving as a bridge between application or service owners and infrastructure owners, letting each team operate in their native environment, yet still collaborate effectively together. Years of operational experience have produced a platform with features and operational capabilities that these teams will find valuable as part of any automation initiative, either enterprise or service provider.

Cisco NSO is a model-driven (YANG) platform for automating your network orchestration. It supports multivendor networks through a rich variety of network element drivers (NEDs). Cisco NSO supports the process of validating, implementing, and abstracting your network configuration and network services, providing support for the entire transformation into intent-based networking.

The following figure illustrates how Cisco NSO acts as a bridge between application owners and infrastructure owners.

## Scalable Sophistication

Automation tooling is like math. Elementary school arithmetic is fine if you need to double a pie recipe, but you will need something like calculus if you are trying to land a rocket on Mars. Similarly, you need tooling that is simple enough to get started easily but powerful enough for your more sophisticated initiatives. As your goals get more complicated, you need to make sure that you have the means to adequately express them. Scale is not just about increasing complexity; it is also about being able to handle an ever-increasing number of services, apps, and devices.

## Flexible and Adaptable Edges

Change is inevitable, so your bridge must be able to easily accommodate new apps and tools on the "north" side of the bridge. Similarly, your bridge must be able to accommodate changes in infrastructure on the "south" side, such as new vendors, virtualization or containerization, and adoption of cloud technologies.

## Normalization

The bridge must be able to abstract the view from the other side—hide the complexity and heterogeneity that is reality. App owners should be able to ask for resources without caring about the implementation details. Similarly, infrastructure owners should see requests in a consistent way regardless of the app, tool, or system making the requests. Because of this normalization and abstraction role, the bridge must also serve as the authoritative source of truth for both sides of the bridge as to what is actually occurring.

## Developer-Centricity

The quality of the programmatic controls available to both sides of the bridge will dictate what can be accomplished and how quickly it can be accomplished. Together, these four principles help deliver on the promise of DevOps. They allow the entire organization to work more cohesively while allowing each team to function autonomously. Infrastructure owners can change and optimize their resources without breaking apps and services. Similarly, new apps and services can be rolled out more quickly and without creating infrastructure churn. Costs are lowered through increased agility, efficiency, and productivity. Customers are happier with products and services that are more relevant, delivered more quickly, and with more predicable quality.

Cisco NSO 5 represents nearly a decade of accumulated wisdom in automating large, complex tier-1 environments. While NSO has its roots in the service provider market, in recent years, more large enterprises are seeing the need for a proven automation solution. The following figure provides an overview of the elements of NSO and how they relate.

![alt text](/DevNet/DEVASC_200-901/Images/image-2318.png)

At a very high level, Cisco NSO has three components:

1. A model-based programmatic interface that allows for control of everything from simple device turn-up and configuration management to sophisticated, full life-cycle service management
2. A fast, highly scalable, highly available configuration database that serves as a single source of truth
3. A device abstraction layer that uses NEDs to mediate access to both Cisco and more than 150 non-Cisco physical and virtual devices.

The following figure illustrates the full DevOps environment encompassing all stages in a services life cycle. You may use a phased approach to get there.

![alt text](/DevNet/DEVASC_200-901/Images/image-2319.png)

The proposed three-phase approach makes it easier to get to full DevOps environment in a more controllable manner:

**Phase 1: Use NSO as a programmable network interface.**

Use NSO to provide a single API into the network. Operations gain a network provisioning and configuration power tool with the ability to perform networkwide CLI and configuration changes from a single interface, in a single transaction, instead of having to individually touch multiple boxes and use different device-specific commands.

**Phase 2: Use NSO for service abstraction.**

NSO draws on device and service models to begin more fully automating service activations and changes. You see an end-to-end view of the service as a whole, instead of just seeing the individual device configurations.

**Phase 3: Use NSO for DevOps infrastructure automation.**

As you make the people and process changes to support agile development and continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), NSO can support that change by enabling everyone involved in the service—product developers, network engineers, provisioning and operations teams—to work together to design and execute new services and changes, quickly and continuously.
