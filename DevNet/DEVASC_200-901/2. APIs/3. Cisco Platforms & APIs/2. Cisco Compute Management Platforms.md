# Cisco Compute Management Platforms

Cisco provides three options for managing compute solutions such as Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) and Cisco HyperFlex—Cisco UCS Manager, Cisco UCS Central Software, and Cisco Intersight.

There are three levels of management power to deploy on Cisco Unified Computing platforms:

- Cisco UCS Manager for simple infrastructure management
- Cisco UCS Central Software for infrastructure management extended across multiple UCS domains
- Cisco Intersight for cloud-based management of Cisco UCS and Cisco HyperFlex

**Cisco UCS Manager:**

- Automates and treats infrastructure as code to improve agility
- Unifies management of Cisco UCS Blade and rack servers, Cisco UCS Mini, and Cisco HyperFlex
- Speeds up daily operations and reduces risks with policy-driven, model-based architecture
- Truly single pane of glass API
- Automatic hardware discovery
- Flexible, programmable, policy-driven setup
- Policy-driven firmware maintenance
- Service profile enabling agile, flexible, simple hardware provisioning, management, monitoring, and maintenance
- Cisco UCS Central utilizes Cisco UCS Manager APIs to enable orchestration of multiple Cisco UCS domains

**Cisco UCS Central Software:**

- Manage multiple Cisco UCS domains from a central point
- Globally manage pools, policies, and firmware for one or more physical locations
- Access centralized inventory and health status

**Cisco Intersight:**

- Cloud-hosted management for Cisco UCS and Cisco HyperFlex
- Simplifies systems management across data center, remote office-branch office (ROBO), and edge environments
- Unique recommendation engine delivers actionable intelligence
- Tight integration with Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) makes support easier

## Cisco UCS Manager

The XML API facilitates integration with a wide range of third-party management tools from more than a dozen vendors. The API allows for custom integration and portals using the Cisco PowerTool for PowerShell and the Python software development kit (SDK). The API also serves as the interface to higher-level Cisco UCS tools, such as Cisco UCS Central Software.

Cisco UCS Central Software provides the following advantages to help make operations and analysis easier compared with a single Cisco UCS Manager:

- Unified control plane for all the elements in the system—centralized logs for compute, network, and storage
- Single source of truth accessible to tools via API
- Centralizes global policies, service profiles, inventory, ID pools, and templates for up to 10,000 servers

Operationally, Cisco UCS Central provides centralization capability for the core aspects of Cisco UCS Management, such as policies, profiles, inventory, faults, firmware updates, and consoles. It uses Cisco UCS Manager technology to simplify global operations with centralized inventory, faults, logs, and server consoles. Cisco UCS Central also provides the foundation for high availability, disaster recovery, and workload mobility

Cisco UCS Central extends the unified management domain for IT administrators, spanning thousands of servers across the data center and around the world. It uses the same model-based architectural framework as Cisco UCS Manager, with an extended API for global automation among Cisco UCS domains. With Cisco UCS Central, the underlying policy-based management philosophy of Cisco UCS Manager is globalized. This delivers the ability to centralize the management of multiple Cisco UCS domains whether they are in a single data center or spread across multiple data centers. This product provides a way in which the management of a growing infrastructure can continue to be simple.

## Cisco Intersight

The Cisco Intersight software as a service (SaaS) platform makes systems management smarter and simpler. Intelligence and automation make daily activities easier and more efficient. Cisco Intersight delivers efficiency of operations for Cisco UCS, HyperFlex, and third-party infrastructure from the data center to the edge.

Cloud-based data center management:

- Global, multisite, data center, edge
- Recommendation engine
- Real-time analytics and machine learning
- Forecasting

DevOps enabled:

- Continuous integration and delivery
- Continuous monitoring
- OpenAPI Specification
- Python and PowerShell SDK

The Cisco Intersight virtual appliance provides the same SaaS benefits while enabling customers to decide which data is sent back to Cisco to conform to organizational requirements.

## OpenAPI Specification Support

Cisco Intersight includes an API that supports the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as the Swagger Specification), a powerful definition format to describe RESTful APIs. Support for the OpenAPI Specification provides users with access to an interoperable REST API with tools that automate the generation of the Cisco Intersight API documentation ([URL](https://intersight.com/apidocs)), API schemas, and SDKs. The Cisco Intersight API includes fully functional Python and PowerShell SDKs.

The API is an integral part of the broader open connector framework Cisco has established to enable the Cisco Intersight ecosystem to evolve. The ecosystem will eventually support a wide range of Cisco and third-party DevOps software.
