# Cisco Compute Management APIs

Cisco offers a range of APIs for its compute (data center) portfolio. They can be divided into these groups:

- **Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Management:** Cisco Intersight and Cisco UCS Manager
- **User Integrations:** Ruby, PowerShell, Python

Cisco UCS is a programmable infrastructure component for the data center. A programmable infrastructure provides an API to the installed software stack (hypervisor, operating system, application) for identification, monitoring, configuration, and control.

The API allows you to integrate the system into higher-level, data center-wide management systems as a single, logical entity. Server, network, and I/O resources are given characteristics, and they are provisioned and configured on demand by applying a service profile to them. This technology supports a unified model-based management of the system. All properties and configurations of this infrastructure are programmable through Cisco UCS Manager, including the following:

- MAC addresses and UUIDs
- Firmware revisions
- BIOS and Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) controller settings
- Host bus adapter (HBA) and network interface card (NIC) settings
- Network security
- Quality of service (QoS)

Cisco UCS Manager PowerTool Suite is a library of Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets that allow you to retrieve and manipulate Cisco UCS Manager managed objects. The Cisco UCS Manager API interactions can be categorized in several distinct sections:

- Sessions
- Methods
- Queries and Filters
- Configurations and Transactions
- Event Subscription

Cisco UCS PowerTool Suite provides services and cmdlets for all the Cisco UCS Manager API interaction categories. Cisco UCS PowerTool Suite also provides cmdlets that allow inspection of object metadata and object hierarchical containment, and object cmdlet action capabilities with pipeline object definitions. The PowerTool Suite helps automate all aspects of Cisco UCS Manager, Cisco UCS Central Software, and Cisco UCS Integrated Management Controller (IMC). There is a cmdlet library for Cisco UCS Central, which manages Cisco UCS Manager systems, and a cmdlet library to manage the Cisco UCS IMC component of the Cisco UCS C- and E-Series servers.

The Cisco Intersight API is a programmatic interface that uses the REST architecture to provide access to the Cisco Intersight Management Information Model. Cisco Intersight API accepts and returns messages that are encapsulated through JSON documents and uses HTTP over Transport Layer Security (TLS) as the transport protocol. Cisco Intersight provides the benefits of cloud-based management that customers have come to appreciate with SaaS products. For example, the Cisco Intersight API is automatically updated when new features are deployed to the cloud and provide programmatic access to new IT infrastructure capabilities.

The Cisco Intersight REST API supports these methods:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- DELETE

All the data from the application is represented in the Cisco Intersight Management Information Model. Some examples of application areas that you can manage with the API include the following:

- Cisco UCS Servers
- Server components such as DIMMs, CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs), storage controllers, and Cisco IMC
- Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects
- Firmware inventory
- Cisco HyperFlex nodes and HyperFlex clusters
- Virtual machines
- VLANs and virtual storage area networks (VSANs)
- Users, roles, and privileges

The Cisco Intersight API is based on the OpenAPI specification, which defines a programming language-agnostic interface description for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The OpenAPI Specification for Cisco Intersight allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic.

When delivered, Cisco Intersight provides downloadable SDK packages for popular programming languages such as Python, as well as Ansible modules. SDKs for dozens of other programming languages can be generated with the help of the open source OpenAPI tools, including Swagger code generators. Separate documents cover available programming-language SDKs. The Cisco Intersight API is an integral part of the broader open connector framework that Cisco has established to enable the Cisco Intersight ecosystem to evolve. The ecosystem will eventually support a wide range of Cisco and third-party DevOps software.
