The figure illustrates the architecture of the Cisco Finesse solution.

Running in the browser are:

- **Cisco Finesse Administration:** The Cisco Desktop Administrator that utilizes the cfadmin (Administrator Web Application Resource [WAR]) and the finesse (REST API WAR) for configuring things for Finesse.
- **Cisco Finesse:** The Cisco Agent and Supervisor Desktops. It also uses the REST API WAR for the API, but its artifacts are served from the desktop (Agent Desktop WAR).

Inside Cisco Tomcat is:

- **Shindig:** The OpenSocial container that serves as a proxy for all requests being made to the web apps.
- **Contact Center Enterprise (CCE) realm:** An authentication realm that is plugged into Cisco Tomcat for doing authentication of all web requests. In CCE, this uses the Administrative Workstation Database (AWDB) for these permissions.
- **WAR files:** These are the primary web applications that are running inside Cisco Tomcat, providing functionality to the Desktop Administrator and the Agent and Supervisor Desktops:
  - **cfadmin:** Provides the dynamic and static resources (HTML, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets [CSS]) for the Cisco Finesse Desktop Administrator.
  - **3rdpartygadget:** Provides the hosting of third-party gadgets within the Finesse server to allow third-party integrators to deploy gadgets without the need for an external web server.
  - **desktop:** Provides the dynamic and static resources (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) for the Cisco Agent and Supervisor Desktops.
  - **finesse:** Provides the Finesse REST API and the funneling of events by doing Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) publishes to the Cisco Finesse Notification Service.
