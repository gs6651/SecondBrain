## Cisco Unified Communications Manager

Cisco Unified Communications Manager exposes multiple APIs that can be used by developers to interact with the Cisco Unified Communications Manager server and its users and devices:

- AXL API
    
- Cisco Emergency Responder API
    
- Platform Administrative Web Services (PAWS) API
    
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager Serviceability XML API
    
- User Data Services (UDS) API
    

AXL API:

- XML/SOAP-based API
    
- Manage Cisco Unified Communications Manager configuration
    

AXL API uses basic authentication:

- Create new application user in Cisco Unified Communications Manager admin page
    

AXL API can be used to do the following:

- Configure devices and directory numbers
    
- Configure users
    
- Configure voicemail
    

The AXL API is an XML/Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based API that provides a mechanism for managing configuration of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Developers can use AXL to create, read, update, and delete objects such as gateways, users, devices, and more. Examples of Cisco Unified Communications Manager objects that can be provisioned with AXL include:

- Cisco Unified Communications Manager groups
    
- Call Pickup groups
    
- Device pools
    
- Dial plans
    
- Directory numbers
    
- Locations
    
- Phones
    
- Regions
    
- Users
    
- Voicemail ports
    

AXL API limits access to its services through HTTP 1.0 basic access authentication. The advantage of HTTP basic access authentication is that it is simple to implement because it uses only HTTP headers.

HTTP basic access authentication requires authorization credentials in the form of a username and password before granting access to a specific URL. The username and password are passed as Base64-encoded text in the header of a subsequent HTTP transaction.

To authenticate a user, use an account created by the Cisco Unified Communications Manager administrator:

- It is recommended that a user and group for your application is created, rather than using the admin user.
    
- Create a special application user for AXL access.
    
- Create a user group for AXL access.
    
- Put the AXL user in this user group.
    

The UDS API is a REST-based set of operations that provide authenticated access to user resources and entities such as user devices, subscribed services, and more from the Cisco Unified Communications Manager database. UDS is designed for web applications and can run on any device.

You can create a custom directory search using UDS APIs or manage user preferences and settings. You can also allow users to enable or disable certain features like Do Not Disturb or Call Forward.

Actions that can be accomplished by using the UDS service include:

- Directory search for users
    
- Manage Call Forward and Do Not Disturb
    
- Set language and locale
    
- Subscribe to IP phone service applications
    
- Reset PIN/password credentials
    
- Configure remote destinations
    

## Cisco Finesse

Cisco Finesse offers multiple REST APIs:

- Cisco Finesse desktop APIs
    
- Cisco Finesse configuration APIs
    
- Cisco Finesse serviceability APIs
    
- Cisco Finesse notifications
    

![[Pasted image 20250829190254.png]]

Cisco Finesse desktop APIs are used by agents and supervisors to communicate between the Cisco Finesse desktop, Cisco Finesse server, Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise, or Cisco Unified Contact Center Express to send and receive information about the following entities:

- Agents and agent states
    
- Calls and call states
    
- Teams
    
- Queues
    
- Client logs
    

Cisco Finesse desktop APIs use basic authentication to authenticate with Cisco Unified Contact Center server.

Cisco Finesse configuration APIs allow the configuration of these entities:

- System, cluster, and database settings
    
- Finesse desktop and call variable layout
    
- Reason codes and wrap-up reasons
    
- Phone books and contacts
    
- Team resources
    
- Workflow and workflow actions
    

Cisco Finesse configuration APIs require administrator credentials (the application user ID and password) to be passed in the basic authorization header. If a user repeatedly passes an invalid password in the basic authorization header, Cisco Finesse blocks user access to all configuration.

Cisco Finesse serviceability APIs allow users to perform these actions:

- **Get system information:** Status of the Cisco Finesse system (includes the deployment type), installed licenses, system authentication mode, and other information
    
- **Diagnostic information:** Performance information and product version
    
- **Run-time information:** Number of logged-in agents, active tasks, and active dialogs
    

Cisco Finesse notifications is a mechanism that sends notifications to clients that subscribe to a specific class or resource. For example, a client that is subscribed to user notifications receives a notification when an agent signs in or out of the Cisco Finesse desktop, information about an agent changes, or an agent state changes. Notification payloads are XML-encoded.

Cisco Finesse clients can interface directly with the Cisco Finesse notification service to send subscribe and unsubscribe requests. Clients subscribe to notification feeds published to their respective nodes.

## Cisco Webex Teams

Cisco Webex Teams APIs allow you to:

- Create conversational bots
    
- Embed video calls
    
- Manage spaces
    

Cisco Webex Teams exposes a REST API that can be used by developers to interact with Cisco Webex Teams. Before using a REST API, you must create a Cisco Webex Teams developer account, where you will get an access token, which you can later use when invoking API calls toward Cisco Webex Teams. This access token should be used only for development and testing purposes and not for production usage.

Cisco Webex Teams REST APIs can manage:

- Rooms
    
- People
    
- Memberships
    
- Messages
    

When making requests to the Cisco Webex REST API, an authentication HTTP header is used to identify the requesting user. This header must include an access token. This access token may be a personal access token, a Bot token, or an OAuth token. Cisco Webex Teams APIs support these methods:

- GET
    
- POST
    
- PUT
    
- DELETE
    

For methods that accept request parameters, the platform accepts either application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type and application/json as a return type.

## Cisco Webex Meetings

Cisco Webex Meetings APIs provide developers the ability to include Webex Meetings functionality into their custom applications:

- **REST API**
    
- **XML API:** Complete suite of Cisco Webex functions such as scheduling, user management, recording management, attendee management, reports, and more
    
- **URL API:** An HTML form-based set of functions that allow developers to offer basic Cisco Webex Meetings functionality from their custom web portals
    
- **Teleconference service provider API:** Provides external teleconference service providers to integrate their teleconferencing service with Cisco Webex Meetings
    

Cisco Webex Meetings XML API enables you to manage XML services, which can be used to set up and manage Cisco Webex Meetings collaboration services. Cisco Webex Meetings services, such as creating a user, modifying information about a user, creating a meeting, exchanging files, and so on, are implemented via a set of operations. You can use these Cisco Webex Meeting operations to facilitate specific aspects of Cisco Webex Meetings online sessions. You can deploy these Cisco Webex Meetings services through the exchange of well-formed XML documents between your application or service, and a Cisco Webex Meetings Server. To access Cisco Webex Meetings services through the exchange of XML documents, you must design your application to send XML request documents to the Cisco Webex Meetings XML server and to process the received responses.

With Cisco Webex XML API, you can manage the following services (entities):

- **User service:** Authenticate, create, delete, and update users.
    
- **General session service:** Create contacts, get API versions, get session information, and list open sessions.
    
- **Meeting service:** Create meetings, create teleconference sessions, delete meetings, and get meetings.
    
- **Training session service:** Check lab availability, create training sessions, delete training sessions, and get lab information.
    
- **Event session service:** Create and delete an event, send an invitation email, and upload an event image.
    
- **Support session service:** Create a support session and get feedback information.
    
- **History service:** List the event attendee and event session history.
    
- **Site service:** Get site, list time zone, and set site.
    
- **Meeting attendee service:** Create meeting attendee, get enrollment information, and list meeting attendees.
    
- **Meeting type service:** Get and list meeting type.
    

Cisco Webex Meetings URL API is based on HTTP and provides a convenient mechanism to offer browser-based external hooks into the Cisco Webex Meetings services. It is typically used for enterprise portal integrations supporting basic interactions such as single sign-on (SSO), scheduling meetings, starting and joining simple meetings, and inviting attendees and presenters.

With Cisco Webex URL API, you can manage the following services (entities):

- **Manage user accounts:** Create a new user account, edit an existing user account, and activate and deactivate user accounts.
    
- **Login/logout:** Use an authentication server to log in or log out from Cisco Webex Meetings hosted websites.
    
- **Managing meetings:** Schedule a meeting, edit a meeting, list all scheduled meetings, list all open meetings, and join an open meeting.
    
- **Modifying my Webex meetings page:** Modify user information and manage a user contact list.
    
- **Using attendee registration forms:** Create a registration form and determine current required, optional, or do-not-display settings for a registration page.
    
- **Managing attendee lists:** Add attendees to a list of invited users and remove attendees from a list of invited users.
    
- **Playing back a recorded event:** Allow an attendee to get a list of recorded events for playback.
    
- **Reporting:** Send email notifications with attendee information.
    

The Cisco TAPI Service Provider (TSP) API allows TSPs to integrate their audio-conferencing service with Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex TSP partners can offer Cisco Webex services to their customer base, while retaining the audio-conferencing business and the customer relationship.

## Cisco Webex Devices

Cisco Webex Devices expose the Experience API (xAPI), which allows an integrator to programmatically invoke commands and query the status of devices that run the Cisco Collaboration Endpoint software and RoomOS.

[![](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/mc_devasc10_06/assets/Other/Monolithic/DEVASC/v1.0/DEVASC_1-0-0_Webex_Devices_001.png)](https://ondemandelearning.cisco.com/apollo-alpha/mc_devasc10_06/assets/Other/Monolithic/DEVASC/v1.0/DEVASC_1-0-0_Webex_Devices_001.png)

The xAPI enables users to customize and extend the touch interface through the use of in-room controls. Users can personalize the user interface and, for example, create custom interactions with peripherals in a meeting room.

The behavior of Webex Devices can be further customized by creating macros. A macro is a small JavaScript program, created by the user, which runs natively on the Webex device. Macros can register and react to any event that is exposed on the API of the device—for example, a system event, status change, or configuration change. If you combine the use of macros with custom user interface panels, you can augment the user interface with local functionality—for example, speed dial buttons.

The xAPI supports these protocols:

- Serial port
    
- SSH
    
- HTTP
    
- WebSocket
    

The xAPI supports these request formats:

- Text
    
- XML
    
- JSON
