# Cisco Security Platforms

The Cisco security portfolio includes several network-, server-, or endpoint-based security solutions. Many of these solutions also provide APIs, making security solutions programmable and adaptive.

Cisco provides a broad security portfolio of products to address different threats in different security categories:

- Network security
- Endpoint security
- Identity management

## Cisco Firepower

Cisco Firepower Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) is the Cisco next-generation network security appliance, offering services such as URL filtering, application control and visibility, advanced malware protection, and so on. The Cisco Firepower NGFW also offers Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) services in a single agile platform. The appliance runs a unified image of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) and Cisco ASA adaptive security appliance code to offer all the NGFW services and IPS services from Cisco Firepower, plus features such as Network Address Translation (NAT), VPNs, and so on from the ASA appliance.

Managed by using the central Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), cloud-based Cisco Defense Orchestrator, or the local Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), the NGFW provides threat protection through real-time contextual awareness, full-stack visibility, and intelligent security automation. Cisco FMC provides deep analytic capabilities and API integration that is not provided by Cisco FDM. Both Cisco Firepower NGFW and Cisco FMC can be physical or virtual appliances. Cisco Firepower NGFW Virtual (NGFWv) and Cisco FMC are available for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), Microsoft Azure, and VMware vSphere environments. Physical or virtual FMCs can manage virtual or physical Cisco Firepower NGFW appliances.

The operating system that is running on Cisco Firepower NGFW is Cisco FTD. Cisco FMC can be used to manage the Cisco FTD system. The Cisco Firepower System requires both the managed device (Cisco Firepower NGFW) that sees the traffic that you are monitoring, and Cisco FMC. Cisco FMC is a network appliance that provides a centralized management console and database repository for your Cisco Firepower deployment. Cisco FMC aggregates and correlates network traffic information and performance data, assessing the impact of events on particular hosts. You can monitor the information that your devices report, and assess and control the overall activity that occurs on your network. Cisco FMC also controls the network management features on your devicesâ€”switching, routing, NAT, VPN, and so on.

You need to register Cisco Firepower NGFW with Cisco FMC. After the communication channel is set up between Cisco FMC and Cisco Firepower NGFW, basic information is exchanged between the two appliances, as shown in the figure. If you change the policy configuration on Cisco FMC for a managed device, that policy change does not take effect until you deploy that policy (known as a deploy or apply). You can deploy the policy immediately or later.

## Cisco AMP and Cisco Threat Grid

Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) accelerates security response by providing visibility and clarity to previously unknown artifacts, and by seeing a threat once and blocking it everywhere.

The power of the Cisco AMP architecture is the integration between components. Any component in the AMP architecture can submit a file to Cisco Threat Grid for dynamic analysis. Files can also be submitted manually by users. When Threat Grid issues a conviction, the Cisco AMP Cloud informs all AMP components worldwide of the conviction.

## Cisco Umbrella

Cisco AMP for Endpoints, or AMP4E, is a lightweight connector that can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac, and Android devices (and Clarity for iOS is available on Apple iOS devices). You will not always have the option of deploying AMP4E on end devices, though.

Consider a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenario, guest devices, and IoT devices. For some devices, such as guest or some BYOD devices, you will not have administrative access to install and manage endpoint security. Other devices, such as manufacturing or medical equipment, might not have sufficient resources to run an endpoint protection agent or might not be using an x86-compatible operating system.

In several cases, you will have to adapt your endpoint security strategy to include devices that you cannot manage, which presents another challenge that you as a security practitioner must solve for your organization: "How do you manage endpoint security for an endpoint that you cannot manage?"

Cisco Umbrella is a Domain Name System (DNS)-based security mechanism that can provide common security for both on-premises and off-premises to provide endpoint security. Cisco Umbrella on-premises deployments do not require an agent to be installed on the endpoint.

The firewall is good for blocking inbound threats, but consider threats that originate inside the network. These threats cannot be stopped by perimeter security because they are already behind the firewall.

Cisco Umbrella can block client connections at the application layer, regardless of network connection or perimeter security, by preventing the client from resolving DNS for the remote destination. If the client cannot resolve DNS for the remote destination, it cannot establish a connection and download the malware. Cisco Umbrella can be used to prevent connections to malicious websites or to websites that violate corporate security policy.

## Cisco ISE

Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is a network access control and policy enforcement platform that allows you to provide highly secure network access to users and devices. It helps you gain visibility into what is happening in your network, such as who is connected and which applications are installed and running. It also shares vital contextual data, such as user and device identities, threats, and vulnerabilities, with integrated solutions from Cisco technology partners so that you can identify, contain, and remediate threats.

The following figure illustrates the five primary functions that are provided by Cisco ISE.

The Cisco ISE ERS API allows ISE database management.

Cisco ISE provides five primary functions to help secure your network and enable your business:

- ISE Visibility includes device posturing and profiling of endpoints on the network. An endpoint could be a mobile device or a server, or it could be a printer, a robotic arm in a manufacturing plant, or an IP-connected door lock.
- Guest Access Management includes Hotspot, Sponsored Guest, and Guest Self-Registration.
- Device Administration provides a centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server for accessing network devices such as routers, switches, load balancers, firewalls, and other devices that implement TACACS and RADIUS.
- Access Control provides discretionary access to network resources or enclaves, based on highly customizable criteria.
- Secure BYOD and Enterprise Mobility includes capabilities of end users to self-register their mobile or BYOD endpoints.

The Cisco ISE External RESTful Services (ERS) API is designed to allow external clients to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on ISE resources. ERS is based on the HTTP protocol and REST methodology.
