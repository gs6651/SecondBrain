# Cisco Network Management Platforms in the Cloud

Another way of managing your infrastructure is to make use of cloud-based management tools, which further simplify the solution by not even requiring you to maintain the management product. There are two Cisco products that use cloud-based management: Cisco Meraki and Cisco Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN).

Cisco Meraki advantages:

- Provides speed and agility
- Simplified infrastructure management
- Using or planning to introduce WAN circuits such as cable, DSL, broadband, 4G/LTE
- Any SD-WAN project with low to medium routing complexity
- Mobile device management

Cisco SD-WAN advantages:

- More powerful options
- Traffic segmentation
- Using existing Cisco infrastructure
- Needed with high routing complexity

## Cisco Meraki

Cisco Meraki is a complete cloud-managed networking solution:

- Wireless, switching, security, and mobile device management (MDM), centrally managed over the web
- Built from the ground up for cloud management
- Integrated hardware, software, and cloud services

The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is an interface for software to interact directly with the Meraki cloud platform and Meraki managed devices. The API contains a set of tools that are known as endpoints for building software and applications that communicate with the Meraki Dashboard for use cases such as provisioning, bulk configuration changes, monitoring, and role-based access controls. The Dashboard API is a modern, RESTful API using HTTPS requests to a URL and JSON as a human-readable format. The Dashboard API is an open-ended tool can be used for many purposes. Here are some examples of how it is used today by Meraki customers:

- Add new organizations, administrators, networks, devices, VLANs, and Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs).
- Provision thousands of new sites in minutes with an automation script.
- Automatically onboard and off-board teleworker devices for new employees.
- Build your own dashboard for store managers, field technicians, or unique use cases.

## Cisco SD-WAN

Through the Cisco SD-WAN vManage console, you can quickly establish an SD-WAN overlay fabric to connect data centers, branches, campuses, and colocation facilities to improve network speed, security, and efficiency. After setting templates and policies, Cisco SD-WAN analytics identifies connectivity and contextual issues to determine optimal paths for users to get to their destination, regardless of their connectivity.

Whether hosted in the cloud or on premises, Cisco vBond and vSmart orchestration and controller platforms authenticate and provision network infrastructure, verifying that the devices connecting to your SD-WAN are authorized. Once connected, SD-WAN platforms find the best path to bring users closer to the applications they need, managing overlay routing efficiency, adjusting in real time to reflect policy updates, and handling key exchanges in Cisco full-mesh, encrypted delivery.

Cisco SD-WAN supports third-party API integration, allowing for even greater simplicity, customization, and automation in day-to-day operations. In addition, Cisco SD-WAN includes the common routing protocols that are critical for all enterprise SD-WAN deployments, such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), and IP version 6 (IPv6).

Through a single dashboard called vManage, Cisco SD-WAN provides:

- **Transport independence:** Guaranteeing zero network downtime, Cisco SD-WAN automates application flexibility over multiple connections, such as the Internet, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), and wireless 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE).
- **Network services:** Rich networking and security services are delivered with a few simple clicks. WAN optimization, cloud security, firewalling, IPS, and URL filtering can be deployed wherever needed across the SD-WAN fabric from a single location.
- **Endpoint flexibility:** Cisco SD-WAN can simplify connectivity across branches, campuses, data centers, or cloud environments, extending the SD-WAN fabric wherever you need it to go. Whether physical or virtual, various Cisco SD-WAN platforms give you unparalleled choice, ensuring that your specific business needs are met.
